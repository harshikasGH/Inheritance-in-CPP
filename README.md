# Inheritance in C++

---

#Aim  
To understand and implement different types of **inheritance in C++**, exploring how classes can reuse and extend functionality through hierarchical relationships.

---

## Theory  

**Inheritance** is one of the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It allows a class (called the **derived class**) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (called the **base class**).

---

## Key Points  

- **Base Class:** The class whose members are inherited.  
- **Derived Class:** The class that inherits from the base class.  
- **Access Specifiers:**  
  - `public` → Public & protected members of base remain accessible.  
  - `protected` → Public & protected members of base become protected.  
  - `private` → Public & protected members of base become private.

## Types of Inheritance  

1. **Single Inheritance**  
   - One base class → One derived class.  
   - Example: `Vehicle → Car`.

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**  
   - A class derived from another derived class.  
   - Example: `University → Department → Lab`.

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
   - Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.  
   - Example: `University → Department, Hostel, Library`.

4. **Multiple Inheritance**  
   - A class inherits from more than one base class.  
   - Example: `Department → University + Facility`.

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**  
   - Combination of two or more types (e.g., hierarchical + multiple).

## Algorithms  

## Single Inheritance  

1. **Start**  
2. Define a base class `Vehicle` with a method `color()`.  
3. Define a derived class `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds `speed()`.  
4. In `main()`:  
   - Create object `myCar`.  
   - Call `color()` and `speed()`.  
5. **End**

---

## Multilevel Inheritance  

1. **Start**  
2. Define base class `University` with `showUni()`.  
3. Define derived class `Department` inheriting `University`, with `showDept()`.  
4. Define derived class `Lab` inheriting `Department`, with `showLab()`.  
5. In `main()`:  
   - Create object `VLSI`.  
   - Call all three methods.  
6. **End**

---

## Hierarchical Inheritance  

1. **Start**  
2. Define base class `University`.  
3. Define three derived classes: `Department`, `Hostel`, `Library`.  
4. Each derived class has its own method.  
5. In `main()`:  
   - Create objects of each derived class.  
   - Call base + derived methods.  
6. **End**

---

## Multiple Inheritance  

1. **Start**  
2. Define base class `University`.  
3. Define base class `Facility`.  
4. Define derived class `Department` inheriting from both.  
5. In `main()`:  
   - Create object `ec`.  
   - Call methods from both base classes + derived class.  
6. **End**

---

## Hybrid Inheritance  

1. **Start**  
2. Combine hierarchical + multiple inheritance.  
   - Example: `University` as base.  
   - `Department` and `Hostel` inherit from `University`.  
   - `Lab` inherits from `Department` and also uses `Facility`.  
3. In `main()`:  
   - Create objects and demonstrate combined features.  
4. **End**

## Conclusion  

This experiment demonstrates the power of **inheritance** in C++:  

- **Code Reusability** – Base class features are reused in derived classes.  
- **Extensibility** – Derived classes can add new features.  
- **Hierarchy Modeling** – Real-world relationships (University → Department → Lab) can be represented.  
- **Flexibility** – Supports single, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple, and hybrid inheritance.  

Inheritance is the foundation for **polymorphism** and advanced OOP design.
